							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/bios/Joji-small.jpg" alt="" /></span>Hey Wildcats,</p>
							<p>My name is Joji Syed, and I’m running for ASG President.</p>
							<p>I’ve been involved with ASG since Fall quarter my Freshman year, and in that time, I’ve seen it from numerous perspectives--B Status Finances, Community Relations, Wild Ideas, Senate, and now, as VP of Community Relations. Each opportunity has allowed me to improve our campus and really make an impact on my peers’ Northwestern experience. Each opportunity has also shown me that there is still so much more that needs to be done.</p>
							<p>And that’s why I find myself running to be president.</p>
							<p>I’m a firm believer in the concept of improvement; so, I’ll be the first to admit ASG can improve how it functions on our campus. As a student government, we can enhance advocating the student voice--advocating for change that our students actually wish to see. After all, if we don’t who will?</p>
							<p>We are also uniquely positioned to unite our campus--from student groups to communities--by being seen as THE central resource for all students. As a former student group president, I’ll admit that I never felt that ASG was a resource that could help my group. That’s an issue when we are on a campus where student groups are more than just a weekly meeting or resume bullet; they provide us a community, and, more often than not, our closest friends.</p>
							<p>With my institutional knowledge and external experiences, I truly believe that I understand how ASG can best serve our campus and positively impact every student’s Northwestern experience. Here’s the conclusion I’ve come to: ASG is in need of a paradigm shift and only the right leadership can provide that. I truly believe that the vision Archie and I have for Northwestern is what is best for ALL Northwestern students. So, I’m looking forward to sharing our NU Deal with you over the next few days.</p>
