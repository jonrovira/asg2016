							<h1 class="major">Meet Archie</h1>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/bios/archie-small.jpg" alt="" /></span>Hey Wildcats,</p>
							<p>My name is Joji Syed, and I’m running for President of ASG at NU.</p>
							<p>I’ve been involved with ASG since the start of my NU journey; I’ve engaged with the organization on a number of different avenues--from Wild Ideas, funding, and community relations committees to senate; and this past year, I’ve had the privilege to serve on the executive board as VP of Community Relations.</p>
							<p>I initially joined asg given the unique opportunity i believe that this student group ascertains: i truly believe that it is the sole body on this campus that has the ability to bring together our mapus--to unite our insanely talented peers together to make Northwestern a better, safer, more enjoyable campus. Each committee position I held helped me work towards this ideal; i stepped out of each role, after i felt i had seized the opportunity for impact;. Now as i step outside of my vp position; i feel the same way; i have made all the possible change that i believe was possible in each position. I seized the opportunity for impact.</p>
							<p>Now, i am running to be your president because i believe that the opportunity this position presents will allow myself to make an impact on this campus that will affects students decades to come. I truly believe that the change that we could make possible through this position is what excites me to run. I exhausted all the opportunities in each role, i want to have the chance to seize this opportunity as well, and you can help me do that.</p>
							<p>As someone who’s seen asg from the inside and out, i’ll be the first to admit, that we’re not the experts at everything. There are groups and communities on this campus that serve impense purpose. And we as a student government often times get caught up in trying to absorb them; that is the complete opposite of what we should be doing. As someone who has served president of a consulting group on campus and a leader in a number of other groups, I can first hand tell you the immense purpose student groups serve our campus--they are communities, our social circle, our friends. That is why we as a student government should view the situation as “how can asg better help your group do its thing on campu?” Our job is to make sure we’re doing everything we can to ensure that every student here has the best northwestern experience possible. So, we’ve split our platform twofold, focusing on what asg is uniquely positioned to accomplish and what asg can do to better elevate student groups to serve their purpose </p>
							<p>I believe asg is in need of a paradigm shift and archie and i are the one to provide it. I’m looking forward to spreading our vision as well as platform with students as i truly believe it is what is best for all northwestern students.</p>
							<p>You may find this hard to believe, but a short three years ago i would never had thought that i would be running for president at my university. But the impact nu has  had on me personally and professionally is ridiculous and that’s why I’ve continued to invest my time in improving this school so that others can have a similar experience to what i have had </p>
							<p>I truly believe in northwestern and more importantly what our student government can do to provide impact, drive change, and instill improvement in our campus.</p>
