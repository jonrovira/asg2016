							<p>I’m Archie Baskaran,  and I’m running to be your ASG Vice President. </p>
							<p>Throughout my time on this campus, I’ve learned that most of the problems we students face are the same problems we faced a decade ago. I’ve also learned to value the student voice as the most powerful asset we have in rectifying faulty institutions.</p>
							<p>I initially viewed ASG as a universal solution to student woes; as the greatest advocate of the student voice, ASG had the ability to coalesce communities and demand change. But that wasn’t the case on campus. Ask the average student on campus, “Do you know what ASG does?” The likely response is “No.”</p>
							<p>That’s what I want to see changed. I believe in the potential for ASG to dramatically affect issues on this campus. I am tired of empty promises. I am done with watching the same issues--social justice, mental health, student conduct and alcohol policy, etc.--be addressed on a surface level. Every year, candidates come to your doorstep telling you they will radically reform institutions. But the same promises are repeated, and repeated, and repeated. A decade later, marginalized communities are still underrepresented, students with mental health issues still face significant hurdles, and alcohol policy has actually worsened.</p>
							<p>I am running because I want ASG to have a salient, positive impact on our Northwestern experiences. I will stand as a strong ally to you to ensure that happens. And over these next several days, I will earn your trust and show you this campaign is not all talk.</p>
							<p>You deserve better.</p>
