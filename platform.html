							<h1>Part 1: A NU Deal for Student Groups</h1>
							<p>Our 400+ student groups are places for students to build community, so making sure they are best positioned to succeed is incredibly important. Everyone talks about addressing wide-reaching issues like funding reform and over-programming, but the largest problem facing student groups right now is a lack of equal access to information and resources.</p>
							<p>That’s where ASG can help. In one year, we know we can’t solve all of the problems student groups face, but we promise to level the playing field and provide the opportunity for groups to maximize their potential.</p>

							<h2 class="major">Streamline Information</h2>
							<p>We want to create a single website for student groups that contains the following:</p>
							<div class="table-wrapper">
								<table>
									<tbody>
										<tr>
											<td>Event Publicity</td>
											<td>The Campus Loop does not go far enough. People either don’t submit to it, or they delete it when they see it in their inbox. We plan on transitioning this weekly update to a monthly advertising calendar, where the submission link will be individually emailed to each student organization chair/co-chair at the start of every month.</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Resources for both A and B Status Groups</td>
											<td>The Student Activities Resource Committee puts out amazing resources like A Status Advice and the Funding Map, but no one ever uses them. We need to leverage ASG’s potential by centralizing all of its student group resources onto one page and making it easy to navigate so student groups can get easier access to the tools they need to succeed.</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Internal Centralized Calendar</td>
											<td>While publicizing events is incredibly important, making sure student group events do not overlap during the planning process is just as necessary. This calendar, which student group leaders will only have access to, will allow them to know when other organizations are planning on putting on their events so they do not overlap.</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Advising Map</td>
											<td>Some student group advisors know what’s up and some don’t. Student groups deserve equal access to information, and that starts with knowing which administrators can help you make your event a success. We want to create an advising map that shows all group advisors, their areas of expertise and their contact information and office hours.</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>AFVP, BFVP and SAVP contact information and office hours</td>
											<td>We want ASG to be a resource for student groups, and that means connecting them with the experts that can help: the Vice President for A Status Finances, Vice President for B Status Finances and the Student Activities Vice President.</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Centralized platform for applications and audition dates:</td>
											<td>ASG will reach out to student groups to collect application links/recruitment information, and centralize that on a page on the ASG webpage for students to more easily browse applications. This will create a “one-stop” shop for student group applications, assisting students and student group executive board members in the process.</td>
										</tr>
									</tbody>
								</table>
							</div>

							<h2 class="major">Reduce Miscommunication</h2>
							<p>We want to make sure student groups are all on the same page. To accomplish this, we will push for:</p>
							<div class="table-wrapper">
								<table>
									<tbody>
										<tr>
											<td>Advisor and AE/GE Training</td>
											<td>There should be no reason why some student groups should have more experienced and knowledgeable advisors and AE/GEs than others. Revamping the training process for advisors and AE/GEs will get everyone on the same page, and make sure all groups have the resources they need to reach their full potential.</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Creating clearer metrics for event success</td>
											<td>While ASG recognizes that not all events are based on bringing the most people, metrics for success are not completely clear to groups. We will work with student group leaders to create clearer metrics for event success so the process for evaluating events is much more transparent.</td>
										</tr>
									</tbody>
								</table>
							</div>

							<h2 class="major">Optimize SOFO</h2>
							<p>Too long has SOFO been a burden on student groups. We plan on improving the SOFO experience by implementing the following changes:</p>
							<div class="table-wrapper">
								<table>
									<tbody>
										<tr>
											<td>Improve SOFO hours</td>
											<td>Treasurers should be allowed to drop off paperwork after hours, then have it verified during check pick-up (assuming there were not errors in the initial paperwork).</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Digital SOFO system</td>
											<td>We will work with SOFO to create an online system for group advisors where they can login and approve purchases and reimbursements.</td>
										</tr>
									</tbody>

							<h1>Part 2: ASG’s NU Deal for You</h1>
							<p>ASG cannot solve all of our campus’ problems, but it has the ability to bring together coalitions of groups to make meaningful change happen. That means tackling our campus’ biggest issues, from elevating the voices of marginalized communities to improving mental health services to reforming Northwestern’s alcohol policy.</p>

							<h2 class="major">Social Justice Platform</h2>
							<p>Anti-blackness, xenophobia, anti-semitism, Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia, racism, sexism, classism, ableism, and more. We are failing the most vulnerable students of our NU community if we continue to remain negligent of their issues and feelings.</p>
							<p>Social justice cannot become tangible unless we stand in strong solidarity with all marginalized communities and work together to deconstruct oppressive systems. ASG will stand as strong allies to marginalized communities and amplify the platforms by which they can maximize their voice. The stronger the voice marginalized students have, the easier it will be to hold administration accountable and transparent.</p>
							<p>No student should feel unsafe on their own campus. As part of our vision, we affirm our commitment to ensure that all students at Northwestern can pursue their dreams -- no matter who they are or where they are from.</p>
							<h4>Maximizing Voice</h4>
							<div class="table-wrapper">
								<table>
									<tbody>
										<tr>
											<td>Greater Access to Administration</td>
											<td>
												<p>Most social justice groups have particular instances of concern they want to have addressed. Too often, however, groups have to reach out to administrators completely on their own.</p>
												<p>ASG’s strength is its connection to administration. We will make it a priority to ensure that the voices of marginalized communities are heard directly by the ASG President, Vice-President, Executive Board, and Administration. At some point, there’s a disconnect between people sharing their experiences but only a few people finding it relevant. Sharing those viewpoints and experiences directly to the administration will have a much stronger impact in facilitating change.</p>
											</td>
										</tr>
									</tbody>
								</table>
							</div>
							<h4>Addressing Marginalized Students’ Mental Health</h4>
							<div class="table-wrapper">
								<table>
									<tbody>
										<tr>
											<td>Mental Health Task Force with Emphasis on Marginalized Students</td>
											<td>
												<p>We will create a task force that will serve as a liaison between the Northwestern student body and the Administration and will work to improve mental health services on campus. The Task Force will be charged with aggressively pursuing the hiring of more CAPS counselors and mental health professionals of marginalized backgrounds. Culturally competent therapists can provide relevant care while better understanding the nexus between marginalization specific to their area of expertise and mental health outcomes. Students should be enabled to attend counseling that doesn’t reinforce the causes which forced them into counseling in the first place.</p>
											</td>
										</tr>
									</tbody>
								</table>
							</div>
							<h4>Increasing Cultural &amp; Socio Economic Competence</h4>
							<div class="table-wrapper">
								<table>
									<tbody>
										<tr>
											<td>Accessibility and Inclusion Training for Student Leaders</td>
											<td>
												<p>Education is critical to breaking down systems of oppression. ASG will help facilitate accessibility and inclusion training for student group leaders, administered by Multicultural Student Affairs, Student Enrichment Services, the Black House, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, etc. We will make this a part of the core curriculum for new student group leader’s training at the Student Organization Symposium.</p>
											</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Accessibility and Inclusion Training for Academic Advisors</td>
											<td>
												<p>Academic advisors may have a good grasp of what’s going on in the classroom, but we believe they should also have a better understanding of the challenges that underrepresented students face on campus. We will improve advisor training so they can better represent marginalized students and are more aware of opportunities that they can take advantage of, such as academic scholarships.</p>
											</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Title IX Education and PACT Training</td>
											<td>
												<p>One in four women and nearly half of gay or bisexual men will experience sexual assault. Duke must adopt a comprehensive, nuanced strategy for addressing sexual assault on campus, and it’s critical that it begins upon students’ arrival on campus freshman year. The following actions need to be taken, recognizing that in isolation they are insufficient:</p>
												<ol>
													<li>Institutionalizing Title IX “Consent Chats” that educate students about bystander intervention and gray-space sexual assault</li>
													<li>PACT training critical masses on Greek/SLG executive boards</li>
													<li>Instituting provisions in the newly created Residential Group Assessment (RGAC) guidelines to ensure steps (1) and (2) are taken</li>
													<li>Ensure resources for victims are accessible to all populations affected by sexual violence -- including Duke's LGBTQ+ community</li>
												</ol>

							<h4>Improving Accessibility</h4>
							<div class="table-wrapper">
								<table>
									<tbody>
										<tr>
											<td>Creating an Event-Subsidy Fund to Help Students of Lower Socioeconomic Status</td>
											<td>
												<p>Student group events are not cheap, and the costs add up. To make it easier for students of lower socioeconomic status, we plan on working with Student Enrichment Services to create a fund for students to help subsidize the costs of attending events like speaker events and theater performances. While this by no means will solve the problems that students of lower socioeconomic status face on campus, it will hopefully make their experience at Northwestern that much better.</p>
											</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Adoption of A Guideline Making Funding Contingent on Disability Accessibility</td>
											<td>
												<p>ASG needs to take steps to ensure that student group events are disability-accessible. As we are trying to redefine the funding metric for events, we push for the adoption of a guideline that makes funding partially contingent on disability and low-income accessibility.</p>
											</td>
										</tr>

							</div>
							<h4>Facilitating Intergroup Dialogue</h4>
							<div class="table-wrapper">
								<table>
									<tbody>
										<tr>
											<td>Fostering Dialogue Between Cultural and Identity Groups</td>
											<td>
												<p>We believe ASG should reach out to groups to find ways to discuss improving relations between them. ASG will facilitate forums between groups and provide a structure for conversation. These forums would be analogous to the IFC/PHA Board, with a focus on issues confronting cultural communities.</p>
												<p>ASG’s goal would be to help groups discuss important issues, such as the balance between cultural awareness programming and activism, the notion of collective identity and what that implies for cultural communities, how to create better safe spaces for students and how to be better allies to other cultural communities and marginalized communities. As of now, Multicultural Students Affairs (MSA) and the Black House facilitate some conversations, but they are very reactionary to events as opposed to ongoing, long-term dialogues. ASG would involve MSA and the Black House in such conversations.</p>

							<h2 class="major">Alcohol and Student Conduct Policy Platform</h2>
							<p>As stated in Northwestern’s Policy Statement on Student Rights and Responsibilities: “At Northwestern University, life outside the classroom is an integral part of the educational process. The exercise of responsibility is an important part of the development of the full potential of the student as an individual and as a citizen. “ To that end, we believe Northwestern should allow students to develop their sense of personal and collective responsibility by allowing the creation of safe, controlled spaces in which students of legal age may consume alcohol. In coordination with the Interfraternity Council and Panhellenic Association, we will work to accomplish the following:</p>
							<h4>Changing Alcohol Policy</h4>
							<div class="table-wrapper">
								<table>
									<tbody>
										<tr>
											<td>Permitting Safe and Regulated Alcohol Consumption on Campus</td>
											<td>
												<p>Alcohol consumption should be permitted for students of legal age in all campus living spaces. Further, any student or student group wishing to host an event at which alcohol will be present should be allowed to register the event with the Office of Student Affairs. If the registered event meets the risk management standards of the university and the students abide by all university, state, and national policies, the event should be permitted.</p>
											</td>
										</tr>
									</tbody>
								</table>
							</div>
							<h4>Reforming Student Conduct Policy</h4>
							<div class="table-wrapper">
								<table>
									<tbody>
										<tr>
											<td>Ending the Freshmen Freeze</td>
											<td>
												<p>By prohibiting Greek chapters from holding official events on campus, the Freshmen Freeze was intended to lessen the stress new students face. However, the policy incentivizes Greek chapters to hold unregulated and unmonitored off-campus social events. This leads to new students wandering unfamiliar Evanston streets late at night. In conjunction with a new alcohol policy that would allow registered events to occur on campus, removal of the Freshmen Freeze policy would generate new excitement in Welcome Week while simultaneously improving relations with our neighbors in Evanston, increasing student safety and increasing administrative oversight.</p>
											</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Creating an Appeals Process</td>
											<td>
												<p>One mistake one night freshman year should not hold you back from pursuing your passions at Northwestern. We will work with the administration to create an appeals process to remove any incidents from a student’s record that could lead to permanent marks.</p>
											</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Adding a Student-led judicial system</td>
											<td>
												<p>To make student conduct decisions more just, we believe our peers should be involved in the process. We will work to create a jury of students that will investigate cases of minor offenses to student conduct and review the actions of ASG senate and affiliated student organizations. This will increase student confidence in the university conduct system, respect for ASG and calls for help when a student’s well-being is in jeopardy. See here (links to Judicial platform).</p>
											</td>
										</tr>
									</tbody>
								</table>
							</div>

							<h2 class="major">Northwestern Judicial Council Platform</h2>
							<p>The Northwestern Judicial Council (NUJC) would be the judicial branch of the Associated Student Government.</p>
							<h4>Authority</h4>
							<p>A 1972 University Committee on Residential Colleges first proposed the idea of a student judicial conduct council. NUJC would serve as both ASG’s highest court and as a hearing panel, (assuming it would be authorized by the University) to address alleged violations of the student conduct standards. NUJC would also function as a supreme court ASG to interpret and review the actions of the Senate as well as ASG recognized organizations, and the student body. It will work separately from other student body judicial systems on campus (such as IFC’s standards board). Constitutional amendments would provide the NUJC with their designated powers.</p>
							<h4>Operations</h4>
							<p>Any student or organization could submit a formal complaint against the ASG President, VP, Senate or any member based on the ASG code of conduct and constitution. This hearing body would also resolve disciplinary cases ranging from minor to serious violations, and has authority to issue the full range of University sanctions.</p>
							<h4>Members of Judicial Council</h4>
							<p>The NUJC would be made up of a small number of student justices including a chief and associate chief, appointed by the ASG President and confirmed by ASG Senate and faculty senate. A faculty or staff member may serve as an advisor and nonvoting member.</p>
							<h4>How This Improves ASG</h4>
							<p>Currently, up to two students can serve during a panel hearing; however, it does not need a student to function. The NUJC consisting of student peers would enhance ASG’s reputation by engendering trust in Northwestern’s review policies.</p>
							<p>For example, for many students, the Responsible Action Protocol (RAP) does not increase the likelihood that a student will call, stay, and cooperate with authorities when with someone who has drunk to excess, because there is little assurance that the reporter will not be scrutinized for alcohol consumption  This can lead to unsafe situations. If students had confidence that student peers would have real oversight over this protocol, the RAP would likely be used more often.  It would also result in the perception that ASG has some real authority on behalf of the student body.</p>
							
							<h2 class="major">Northwestern Judicial Council Platform</h2>
							<p>Northwestern has made great strides to improve mental health resources on campus, with the administration recently announcing that they plan on eliminating session limits for CAPS services. Student groups like NU Active Minds and NU Listens have also worked incredibly hard to help student facing mental health related issues. But there’s still a negative stigma that surrounds mental health on our campus. Working with CAPS officials and student groups, we want to change our campus’ attitude towards mental health and to continue improving access to mental resources on campus by developing the following:</p>
							<h4>Mental Health Cultural Shift Across Campus</h4>
							<div class="table-wrapper">
								<table>
									<tbody>
										<tr>
											<td>Wellness chairs as student group executive board positions</td>
											<td>
												<p>To break the negative stigma around mental health and get students connected with important resources, we want to add a Wellness Chair as an executive position to 50 student groups. We will work with CAPS and student group leaders to accomplish this. More specifically:</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Each Wellness Chair will serve as liaisons and points of contact  between CAPS and student groups-to continue the discussion on mental health. As a familiar face, this student can develop relationships with group members and provide students with the information that is lost and forgotten after the first few weeks of school.</li>
													<li>This will aid in de-stigmatizing the culture surrounding mental health by directly helping students, rather than waiting for students seek to help on their own.</li>
													<li>The Wellness Chairs will be trained by CAPS in QPR (Question, Persuade, Respond) and Active Listening and overseen and assigned by an oversight committee of 10 members. This committee  will standardize programming, procedure and content among themselves, and then will be responsible for overseeing 5 Wellness Chairs each and distributing the information among them.</li>
													<li>After beginning with student groups, we hope to expand this position to greek chapters and residential halls/communities.</li>
												</ul>

										<tr>
											<td>Bi-monthly, peer-led sharing sessions</td>
											<td>
												<p>Targeting partnerships with NU Active Minds, NU Listens, Feinberg medical students in the Patient Perspectives program  and WATCH counselors, we will seek to develop bimonthly, peer-led sharing sessions where students struggling with mental health problems can meet to discuss a number of topics and share their experiences. We hope to bring together the members of each of these groups, all of whom have the requisite experience and passion to support students experiencing mental-health related issues.</p>

												<p>Student Athletes, though many lead remarkably different lives than other Northwestern students, are embedded within the same fabric that is the NU community. However, historically speaking, ASG has not been representative of student athletes, though they comprise more than 500 members of the student body.</p>
												<p>Student Athletes, mandated by the NCA, have a Student Athlete Advisory Council (SAAC), which forms their version of ASG. Our administration’s goal is to form an excellent working partnership with the SAAC so that we can better represent a core part of our Northwestern peers who have never fully been integrated into the student government.</p>
