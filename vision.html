							<p>ASG’s goal is to ensure that every Northwestern student has their best possible college experience. But has it really done that?</p>
              <p>We don't think so.</p>
							<p>Many students are disillusioned with ASG, believing it does not represent their voice or their interests. And rightfully so--we’re falling short on our responsibilities. It’s time we question the big issues that our campus faces and truly advocate for what students want to see done. We want to create a paradigm shift in the way ASG operates. We’re done with small band-aid fixes and empty promises; we will challenge administration to hear what students want changed. Our student groups have done an incredible job tackling so many problems affecting our campus, from mental health to creating safe spaces, but where they fall short is where we believe ASG needs to step up.</p>
							<p>So, our platform is two-folded, focusing on what ASG can uniquely offer this campus and how ASG can help existing student groups and communities better implement their missions on campus.</p>
							<p>Here is what we propose to you: A NU Deal. It's time for ASG to once again make a difference in each and every student experience at Northwestern. Our paradigm shift will make sure ASG matters to you for longer than election week -- it will ensure it makes an impact on you for your entire Northwestern experience.
